# cheat-sheet
This is a school project I did through Codecademy.  The idea is to create a cheat sheet for myself.
Right now I just have some basic HTML tags and attributes, but I hope to extend it to CSS, JavaScript, and git later on.

I realize I have a duplicate of this on my Github.  Truth is, I lost the folder for this one.  I have no idea where I put it or what happened to it.  I had a duplicate on my computer (not sure why) that I had already updated with a CSS table, so I pushed it to Github.  I apologize for any confusion or inconvenience this may cause anyone in the future.  For the updated version, you can go to my coding-cheat-sheet repository.  Again, I'm sorry for any trouble this may cause in the future but I don't want to delete this repository until I find its folder on my computer, just in case that would cause even worse problems down the line.
